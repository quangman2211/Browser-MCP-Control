# Multi-Agent Handoff Protocols

## Protocol Overview
This document defines coordination protocols between agents to ensure smooth workflow và minimize conflicts.

## Core Handoff Types

### 1. Frontend-Backend Handoff (Sarah ↔ Mike)

#### Trigger Conditions:
- UI component needs data from server
- API endpoint is ready for frontend integration
- Data format changes require coordination

#### Sarah → Mike Process:
```yaml
frontend_to_backend:
  trigger: "UI component needs data"
  steps:
    1. Sarah creates interface contract specification
    2. Sarah submits API request to Mike với requirements
    3. Mike reviews và provides feedback on feasibility
    4. Mike accepts contract và provides timeline
    5. Mike implements API endpoint
    6. Mike provides test data và endpoint documentation
    7. Sarah integrates với mock data initially
    8. Mike provides real endpoint
    9. Sarah switches to real data integration
    10. Both agents conduct joint integration testing
  
  deliverables:
    - Interface contract document
    - API specification
    - Test data samples
    - Integration test results
```

#### Mike → Sarah Process:
```yaml
backend_to_frontend:
  trigger: "API ready for UI integration"
  steps:
    1. Mike completes API implementation
    2. Mike publishes API specification với examples
    3. Mike notifies Sarah với API documentation
    4. Sarah reviews endpoints và data formats
    5. Sarah provides feedback on API usability
    6. Mike addresses frontend-specific concerns
    7. Sarah creates UI components for integration
    8. Mike provides comprehensive test data
