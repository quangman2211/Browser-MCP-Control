# Todo Management Protocol - MANDATORY for Multi-Agent System

## Overview
This protocol establishes MANDATORY requirements for todo system management across all agents. Compliance is required before any project work can begin.

## Core Principles

### 1. Todo-First Development
- **RULE**: No project work begins without updated todos
- **RATIONALE**: Ensures accountability, coordination, và progress tracking
- **ENFORCEMENT**: Project execution is blocked until compliance

### 2. Agent Accountability
- **RULE**: Each agent owns và maintains their todo system
- **RATIONALE**: Clear responsibility và ownership of tasks
- **ENFORCEMENT**: Non-compliant agents are excluded from coordination

### 3. Inter-Agent Coordination
- **RULE**: Dependencies between agents must be documented in todos
- **RATIONALE**: Prevents coordination failures và blockers
- **ENFORCEMENT**: Handoff protocols require todo validation

## Mandatory Todo Management Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Project Todo Preparation

#### Alex (Project Manager) - MANDATORY FIRST
```yaml
responsibilities:
  - Update project-level todos in todos/project-todo.md
  - Define project scope, timeline, và success criteria
  - Assign high-level tasks to appropriate agents
  - Coordinate với all agents for individual todo updates
  - Validate todo completeness across team

blocking_conditions:
  - Project todos not updated for new project
  - Agent assignments unclear or missing
  - Timeline và milestones not defined
  - Agent coordination not completed

success_criteria:
  - todos/project-todo.md reflects new project
  - All agents have clear task assignments
  - Dependencies identified và documented
  - Timeline và priorities established
```

```

### Phase 2: Todo Validation và Approval

#### Validation Checklist
```yaml
project_level_validation:
  - todos/project-todo.md updated với current project
  - Clear project goals và success criteria defined
  - Agent assignments documented
  - Timeline realistic và achievable
  - Dependencies identified

agent_level_validation:
  - All agent todo files updated
  - Previous project tasks archived properly
  - New tasks clearly defined với priorities
  - Dependencies documented
  - Deadlines realistic và coordinated

inter_agent_coordination:
  - Sarah-Mike API contracts identified
  - Emma integration points documented
  - David quality requirements defined
  - Doc information needs specified
  - All handoffs planned
```

#### Approval Process
```yaml
step_1_individual_validation:
  - Each agent validates their own todos
  - Self-assessment of completeness
  - Dependency identification

step_2_peer_review:
  - Agents review related dependencies
  - Sarah-Mike coordination validation
  - Emma integration feasibility check
  - David testing requirement validation

step_3_alex_final_approval:
  - Alex validates all agent todos
  - Confirms project feasibility
  - Approves timeline và resource allocation
  - Grants project execution permission
```

### Phase 3: Ongoing Todo Management

#### Daily Todo Maintenance
```yaml
daily_requirements:
  - Update task progress status
  - Mark completed items as DONE
  - Add new tasks as discovered
  - Update blockers và dependencies
  - Communicate status changes

frequency: Daily
responsibility: Individual agents
reporting: Weekly to Alex
```

#### Weekly Todo Review
```yaml
weekly_review:
  - Alex reviews all agent progress
  - Identifies và resolves blockers
  - Adjusts priorities based on progress
  - Updates project timeline if needed
  - Coordinates inter-agent dependencies

frequency: Weekly
facilitator: Alex
participants: All agents
outcome: Updated todos và coordination plan
```

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Project Blocking Conditions
```yaml
automatic_blocking:
  - Any agent todos >7 days outdated
  - High-priority tasks unresolved >14 days
  - Dependencies unclear or undocumented
  - Agent assignments missing or ambiguous

manual_blocking:
  - Alex assessment of todo quality
  - Stakeholder concerns about progress tracking
  - Quality gate failures due to poor planning
  - Inter-agent coordination failures
```

### Compliance Monitoring
```yaml
automated_checks:
  - Todo file modification dates
  - Task completion rates
  - Dependency documentation quality
  - Timeline adherence

manual_reviews:
  - Alex weekly todo audits
  - Peer review của dependencies
  - Stakeholder progress assessments
  - Quality gate evaluations
```

### Escalation Procedures
```yaml
level_1_agent_non_compliance:
  action: Alex coordination meeting
  timeline: 24 hours
  outcome: Todo update commitment

level_2_continued_non_compliance:
  action: Agent exclusion từ project
  timeline: 48 hours
  outcome: Task reassignment

level_3_project_risk:
  action: Stakeholder escalation
  timeline: 72 hours
  outcome: Project timeline adjustment
```

## Todo Quality Standards

### Required Todo Attributes
```yaml
task_definition:
  - Clear, actionable description
  - Specific deliverables identified
  - Success criteria defined
  - Timeline/deadline specified

priority_classification:
  - High: Critical path items
  - Medium: Important but not blocking
  - Low: Nice-to-have enhancements

status_tracking:
  - Pending: Not yet started
  - In Progress: Currently working
  - Blocked: Waiting for dependency
  - Completed: Finished và validated

dependency_documentation:
  - Dependent agents identified
  - Handoff requirements specified
  - Coordination timing planned
  - Success criteria agreed
```

### Todo Template Format
```yaml
task_template:
  title: "Clear, actionable task description"
  description: "Detailed requirements và context"
  agent: "Responsible agent name"
  priority: "High/Medium/Low"
  status: "Pending/In Progress/Blocked/Completed"
  deadline: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  dependencies:
    - agent: "Dependent agent"
      requirement: "What is needed"
      timeline: "When needed"
  deliverables:
    - "Specific output 1"
    - "Specific output 2"
  success_criteria:
    - "Measurable outcome 1"
    - "Measurable outcome 2"
```

## Integration với Other Protocols
