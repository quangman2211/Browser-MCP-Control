# Old Todo System Archive

This directory contains the previous complex todo system that was replaced by the simplified single-file `TODO.md` approach.

## Archive Date
Current Sprint

## Why Archived
The old system was overly complex with:  
- 8 separate todo files (project + 6 agents + daily)
- 140+ lines per agent file
- Too verbose with celebration text
- Hard to maintain and update
- Redundant information across files

## New System
Replaced with single `TODO.md` file featuring:
- Clear agent function boundaries
- No overlapping responsibilities  
- Actionable tasks focus
- Easy maintenance
- Quick project overview

## Files Archived
- `project-todo.md` - Main project todos
- `daily-todo.md` - Daily planning template  
- `agents/alex-todo.md` - Project Manager todos
- `agents/sarah-todo.md` - Frontend Developer todos
- `agents/mike-todo.md` - Backend Developer todos
- `agents/emma-todo.md` - Integration Engineer todos
- `agents/david-todo.md` - QA Engineer todos
- `agents/doc-todo.md` - Documentation Specialist todos

These files are preserved for reference and lessons learned for future project management improvements.
