## 📝 PHASE-BASED USAGE NOTES

### How to Use Phase-Based System
1. **Current Phase determines focus** - All agents work on phase-specific tasks
2. **Phase exit criteria must be met** - Cannot advance until criteria satisfied  
3. **Alex manages phase transitions** - Coordinates team movement between phases
4. **Agents maintain specialization** - Function boundaries remain constant across phases

### Phase Management Rules
- **Sequential progression**: Complete current phase before next
- **Quality gates enforced**: Meet exit criteria before advancing
- **Cross-phase work discouraged**: Focus on current phase priorities
- **Exception handling**: Alex approves any phase-back movements

### Team Coordination
- **Phase kickoffs**: Alex facilitates phase transition meetings
- **Daily standups within phase**: Focus on current phase deliverables
- **Phase reviews**: Validate exit criteria before progression
- **Retrospectives**: Capture phase-specific lessons learned
